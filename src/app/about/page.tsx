							I am an oil-painter, watercolourist, printmaker and ceramicist, living in Felixstowe, a
							container port on the Suffolk coast in England, who exhibits with the Ipswich Art Society,
							the Society of East Anglian Watercolourists and Inky Fingers, a Suffolk based group of
							printmakers.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							As an oil painter my interests are in Surrealism and social comment. The best description of
							my work would be Social Surrealism, which is also a large element of my printmaking. My
							watercolour leanings are more general â€“ landscape and still life, with a recent interest in
							urban landscape, which also figures heavily in my printmaking.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							In printmaking, as well as the idioms mentioned above, I produce prints featuring black
							humour. Although I don&apos;t paint abstracts, I have a great love of colour and shape of an
							abstract nature which informs a large part of my ceramics output.
